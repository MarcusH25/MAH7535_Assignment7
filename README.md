My research's goal was to determine the link between Texas's county-level revenue and how that affected vaccination rates. The fact that COVID-19 made such a big influence on my senior year of high school in Texas, where I was born and bred, sparked my interest in this subject. I wanted to find out whether there was a correlation between the counties in Texas with the highest vaccination rates and per capita income. I was also intrested in   Identifying the biases that impacted these rates and why.

Any known issues or potential issues, such as sources of bias in collection: 
I found that there can be many biases caused by the distribution of vaccines based on an individual's wealth. First off, there is a well-known problem with wealth disparity, and those who are less fortunate financially might not have as easy access to healthcare services as people who earn more money do. This may result in unequal vaccination rates, with socioeconomically disadvantaged people having a lower likelihood of receiving the shot. The distribution of vaccines may also be influenced by a person's location. In Texas, for instance, some regions may get more vaccinations because of their greater per capita incomes. This can lead to even more inequities in vaccination distribution while also perpetuating existing socioeconomic gaps. Also, there were many prejudices in this study that resulted in people in certain areas having higher fatality rates because they refused to receive the vaccination according to their own personal principles. The prejudices of those who chose to NOT EVEN BELIEVE IN COVID-19, in my opinion, had a MASSIVE IMPACT on death rates. After closely examining the income per capita by county in Texas, I discovered that all counties had comparable incomes, but the distribution of vaccination rates across the various counties was highly variable. I believe this was due to prejudices among the county's residents who felt that the impact of COVID-19 wasn't a major problem to them and made the problem worse.
